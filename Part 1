Part 1: Code Review & Debugging
Identified Issues:
Method Syntax Error- methods="[POST]" is incorrect syntax - should be methods=['POST']
Missing Input Validation- No checks for required fields
No Error Handling- Database operations may fail
SKU Uniqueness Not Checked- No check for duplicate SKUs
No Transaction Management- Separate commit may leave data inconsistent
Initial Quantity Not Validated- Could be negative or non-integer

Impact of Issues:
Method Syntax- Endpoint won't handle POST requests properly
Input Validation- Could lead to 500 errors or corrupt data
Error Handling- Users won't know what went wrong
SKU Uniqueness- Duplicate products could be created
Quantity Validatio- Negative inventory may be created
